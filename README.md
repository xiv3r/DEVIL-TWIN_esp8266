It uses an ESP8266 to attack a WiFi network using Deauther & Evil-Twin AP method.

## FEATURES :
* Dark themed UI
* WIFI Refresh button (without reloading the page manually)
* Wi-Fi Signal Strength show with -dbm
* Deauthentication of a target WiFi access point
* Evil-Twin AP to capture passwords with password verification against the og access point
* It can do both attacks at the same time, no toggling of the deauther is required. 


## Install using Arduino IDE
1. Install Arduino IDE
2. In Arduino go to `File` -> `Preferences` add this URL to `Additional Boards Manager URLs` ->
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpacehuhnTech/arduino/main/package_spacehuhn_index.json`  
3. In Arduino go to `Tools` -> `Board` -> `Boards Manager` search for and install the `deauther` package  
4. Download and open [Devil-Twin](https://github.com/mahadidot/DEVIL-TWIN_esp8266/Deauther-Evil-M4H4DI.ino.ino) with Arduino IDE
6. Select an `ESP8266 Deauther` board in Arduino under `tools` -> `board`
7. Connect your device and select the serial port in Arduino under `tools` -> `port`
8. Click Upload button

# How to use:
- Connect to the AP named `M4H4D!~H4$$4N` with password `devil2in` from your phone/PC.
- Select the target AP you want to attack .
- Click the Start Deauthing button to send deauth frames and start kicking devices off the selected network.
- Click the Start Evil-Twin button. {optionally reconnect to the newly created AP named same as your target. (will be open)}
- You can stop any of the attacks by visiting 192.168.4.1/pro while conected to Evil-Twin AP or by resetting the ESP8266.
- Once a correct PASSWORD is found, AP will be restarted with default ssid "M4H4D!~H4$$4N" / "devil2in" and at the bottom of a table you should be able to see something like "Successfully got password for - `TARGET_SSID` - `PASSWORD`
